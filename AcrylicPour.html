      <h3>What is Acrylic Pouring?</h3>
      <p>
        Acrylic Pouring is a fascinating fluid painting technique. It is based
        on acrylic paint, which can be brought into a liquid, pourable
        consistency with the addition of Pouring Medium and other additives as
        required. Depending on the technique, this liquefied paint is then
        poured into each other or tilted onto the canvas and distributed by
        tilting the painting surface. Depending on the choice of the color, the
        medium and the additives, different effects are created.
      </p>
      <h3>A Happy Accident: The "Discovery" of Acrylic Pouring</h3>
      <p>
        Although Paint Pouring and Fluid Painting has exploded in popularity
        quite recently, the technique itself has been around since the 1930‚Äôs. A
        Mexican artist (and political activist) by the name of David Alfaro
        Siqueiros stumbled across this technique in his studio which he
        described as ‚Äúaccidental painting‚Äù.
        <br />
        <br />
        Siqueiros immediately fell in love with the aesthetics, a happy marriage
        between science and art, complexity and beauty, achieved with very
        little effort. His fascination with this phenomenon led him to the
        science of Fluid Dynamics. This ‚Äúaccidental painting‚Äù technique went on
        the inform the work of some of the great artists such as Jackson
        Pollock.
